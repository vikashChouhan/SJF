# Shortest Job First Algorithm (SJF)

### Implementation of Shortest Job First algorithm in C Language

This is primary working of shortest job first algorithm in process scheduling.

### Input
Program will ask user to input number of process, and then arrival and burst time respectively for each process.

### Output
Program will output waiting time, turnaround time and process excecution order.

**[NOTE: In output few notations are used as given below ]**</br>
**2AT** - It means that 2 unit is Arranging Time taken by scheduler.</br>
**[2-3]** - Here, 2 is start time and 3 is end time, means that particular process ran from 2 to 3 unit time.
